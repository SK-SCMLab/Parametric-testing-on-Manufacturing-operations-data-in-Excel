# 🛖 Parametric-testing-on-Manufacturing-operations-data-in-Excel
This repository contains Excel-based case study demonstrating how to apply parametric testing to real-world manufacturing operations data including:

- 1 Sample T.Test and Z.Test
- Chi-Square Hypothesis test
- 2 Sample T.Test
- 2 Sample Paired Test
- F.Test for independent groups

## 🏝 1 Sample T.Test & Z.Test
These tests help to determine whether a sample mean differs significantly from a known or hypothesized population mean. But they differ in when and why you use each. 

| *1 Sample Z.Test* | *1 Sample T.Test* |
|-------------------|-------------------|
| 1. Population standard deviation is known | 1. Population standard deviation is unknown |
| 2. Sample size is large (typically n≥30) | 2. Sample size is small (n<30) |
| 3. Population is normally distributed | 3. Population is assumed to be approximately normal | 
| 4. To test if the sample mean (x̄) is significantly different from a known population mean (μ), assuming σ is known | 4. To test if sample mean differs from the population mean. But the t-distribution accounts for extra uncertainty in estimating σ from the sample |
